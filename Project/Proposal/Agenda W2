1. Project:
   - credit risk modelling dateset: german credit dataset http://freakonometrics.free.fr/german_credit.csv
     - I think too many people have worked on the dataset and will not really be an original project? Thoughts?
   - Datasets I created:
     - ~250k records of car sales data scraped from carsales.com.au
       - To create this dataset, one of the challenges was to scrape all individual listings to get the car color.
         - Possible solution is to write a vehicle color recognition algorithm that identified the color.
     - rent listings from domain.com.au
     - personal movies data from trakt (~120 records)
   - AirBnB prediction for rent? - with price change? 
     - Can we link airbnb and realestate data to find good investment deals? i.e. rent a place from real estate and list it on airbnb?

2. Course progress - still going through the stats materials.
