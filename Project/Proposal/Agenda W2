1. Project:
   - credit risk modelling dateset: german credit dataset http://freakonometrics.free.fr/german_credit.csv
     - I think too many people have worked on the dataset and will not really be an original project? Thoughts?
   - Datasets I created:
     - ~250k records of car sales data scraped from carsales.com.au
     - rent listings from domain.com.au
     - personal movies data from trakt (~120 records)
   - AirBnB prediction for rent? - with price change?
